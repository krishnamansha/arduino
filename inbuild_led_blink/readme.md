inbuild_led-_blink_arduino
setup(): This function runs once when the program starts. We set the built-in LED pin (LED_BUILTIN) as an output. loop(): This function runs repeatedly.
It turns the LED on (digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH)), waits for 1 second (delay(1000)), turns the LED off, and then waits for another second.
